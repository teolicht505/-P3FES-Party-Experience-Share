# Share Party Experience
## Description
This cheat ensures that all your party members, whether they are actively fighting in the current battle or waiting at the entrance, receive the same amount of experience points. No more leaving your favorite characters under-leveled just because they weren't in the active party.

## Compilation
This cheat is written in a custom language for PS2 cheats called CLPS2C, so the first step to compile this cheat is to use the [CLPS2C-Compiler](https://github.com/NiV-L-A/CLPS2C-Compiler/tree/master).

However, in the current version of the compiler (1.0.1 at the time of writing), a bug causes the cheat to compile incorrectly, resulting in a game crash during testing. To avoid this, you will need to use [alexankitty's](https://github.com/alexankitty) keystone pull request, which can be found [here](https://github.com/alexankitty/keystone). This ensures that the cheat compiles and runs correctly in the game.
